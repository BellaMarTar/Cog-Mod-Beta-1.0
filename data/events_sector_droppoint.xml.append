	<text>You arrive at the listed coordinates and are more than a little surprised to find a guard at the supposed shop. Even more concerning is how it immediately turns to face you.

                The enemy ship sees your crewmember and immediately powers down. "We didn't realize you were that important. Here, take this and forgive our trouble causing nature." A crate of supplies is launched toward your ship before they jump away.

            The ship hesitates. "You're lucky I'm not too interested dealing with those damn Legal Eagles again" the captain grunts. "Get lost before I change my mind." They power off their weapons and refuse any further communications. Best you leave until they change their mind

            "Mercy?" the captain laughs. "Do I look like I give a damn for some fleshy thing?" Their weapons charge as they move in to attack.
